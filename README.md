# MBTA_BOARD

## About
This program is designed to display the arrival times of the MBTA trains for a given station. It uses the [MBTA public API](https//www.mbta.com/developers/v3-api) to track the arrival times of the trains. An API key is necessary to for this to run. It can be obtained [here](https://api-v3.mbta.com/login). The program will prompt you for this key or you can hard code it in on app.py

## Running
Run app.py. The program will prompt you for your API key and station name of where you would like to target the arrivals. THIS STEP IS CASE SENSITIVE AND THE PROGRAM WILL CRASH IF DONE WRONG. Below is a list of all the stations in the MBTA. Once the station is in there might be a short delay as the script reaches out to the API. In the meantime in your browser go to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

This is kind of a quick project for me so I won't be building it out much more. If you would like to contribute though please feel free to fork this repo and submit a pull request with the updates.
